# Machine-Learning
These are some popular Machine Learning Algorithms which I have implemented with some data sets. These include implementation of Linear Regression(multi variate), Gradient descent for Logistic and Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random forests, Naive Bayes. They all are written in python 3.5 .
